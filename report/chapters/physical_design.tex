\chapter{Physical Design}
\label{pd}
The physical design of the unit has been achieved by the usage of a script (Appendix \ref{appendix12}). As for the synthesis, this script is in charge of preparing the environment and start the real script for the physical design.\\ This step is very well known as a computing intensive step, even more then the synthesis since the granularity of details is bigger than the one in the synthesis. Therefore, for boosting-up the performance the script automatically sets the usage of six threads instead of only one.\\\\
Nevertheless the variety in the design space, only a subset of them has been choosen for being placed on a die. In particular the unconstrained desing, the minimum area and a 10\% less of the clock frequency and only the 10\% less of the clock frequency designs. It is worth to mention that the physical design does not use the RTL description but it uses the gate-level netlist of the RTL, produced by the synthesis.\\
\section{Results}
In the following pages, results are presented as images of the design on the same die.
