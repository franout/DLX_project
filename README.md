### Clone
 Clone this repo to your local machine using and feel free to contribute!
  ```shell
  $ git clone https://github.com/franout/DLX_project.git
  ```
  

### Setup
You need to have installed a HDL simulator tool (for the simulation) and a synthesis tool (in case you want to synthesize the design).
In this project Questa Sim 10.7 and Design Compiler have been used.
  
  
## Architecture

The DLX is essentially a cleaned up (and modernized) simplified MIPS CPU. The DLX has a simple Big Endian 32-bit load/store pipelined architecture, somewhat unlike the modern MIPS CPU.

- Test Bench General architecture
  * Unit Under Test
  
  * DLX top level entity 
  
  
- Customizable hardware parameters (pre-synthesis)
    * IR size, bitwidth of Instruction Register 
    * PC size, bitwidth of Program Counter

## Software

For creating creating the hex dump file to be used in the simulation (loaded in the Instruction Data Ram):
```shell
  $ ./software/assembler.sh {ASM_FILE_PATH}
  ```
The produced hexadecimal file should be copied in the memories folder.

Moreover, in the memories folder it is present also a python script for generating random data suitable for the DRAM.
```shell
  $ ./hardware/dlx/test_bench/memories/generate_random_values_dram.py
  ```
## Simulation  

## Synthesis 

## Layout


## Tests 
For functionally verify the microprocessor refers to the testbench in System Verilog. 
They are divided for each stage and control unit for regression test
```shell
  $ ./scripts/regression_test.sh
  ```
While there will be a final testbench for the DLX top level entity
