The DLX (pronounced "Deluxe") is a RISC processor architecture designed by John L. Hennessy and David A. Patterson, the principal designers of the Stanford MIPS and the Berkeley RISC designs (respectively), the two benchmark examples of RISC design (named after the Berkeley design).

The DLX is essentially a cleaned up (and modernized) simplified MIPS CPU. The DLX has a simple 32-bit load/store architecture, somewhat unlike the modern MIPS CPU. As the DLX was intended primarily for teaching purposes, the DLX design is widely used in university-level computer architecture courses.
